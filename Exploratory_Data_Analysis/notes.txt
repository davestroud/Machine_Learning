How do we get meaningful information from data?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is the process of investigating datasets, elucidating
subjects, and visualizing outcomes. EDA is an approach to data analysis that applies a variety
of techniques to maximize specific insights into a dataset, reveal an underlying structure, 
extract significant variables, detect outliers and anomalies, test assumptions, develop models, 
and determine best parameters for future estimations.
